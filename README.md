## 💡 Major Insights & Recommendations

1. **Target Young Employees:** The critical attrition of employees aged 18-25 calls for enhanced onboarding, mentoring, and career-path clarity.
2. **Address High-Attrition Departments:** Sales and HR should be priorities for retention strategies like engagement programs and employee feedback loops.
3. **Evaluate Forced Attritions:** Since over half of attritions are forced, investigate HR policies and improve transparency.
4. **Beyond Compensation:** Consider non-monetary motivators such as recognition, flexible working conditions, and career development pathways.
5. **Leverage Diversity Trends:** Continue inclusive hiring and supportive environments, reinforcing positive work-life balance and gender equity.
6. **Career Development Focus:** Provide clear internal growth paths to counter resignation motivated by “Better Opportunities.”
